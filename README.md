# Python-Lambda-Functions-Expense-Tracker-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the second project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([verify_card_number.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Luhn-Algorithm-Python-Project/blob/main/verify_card_number.py)), which used Python to apply the Luhn algorithm - for credit card number validation. This defined two functions, `verify_card_number()`, which took a 'credit card' number and applied the Luhn algorithm to this - to determine if it was valid or not, by returning a boolean value. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to achieve this, my project [Luhn Algorithm Problem Solving Thought Process Notes.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Luhn-Algorithm-Python-Project/blob/main/Luhn%20Algorithm%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) notes also contain more information regarding this. The second function defined by the project .py file, the `main()` function, tested this credit card validation function on a dummy credit card number. This enabled me to invest in my function writing skills with Python and marked the successful completion of the second project in the certification.
